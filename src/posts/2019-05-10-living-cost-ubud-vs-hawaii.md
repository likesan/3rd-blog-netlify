Hawaii looks so expensive, more than living in Bali.

Now, according to [this page](https://expatistan.com/cost-of-living/comparison/ubud/honolulu)

It seems the cost is based on the resources are where it comes from.

In Hawaii, most of items for living comes from out of island.
because of that, almost living items prices include Import processing fee.

But, Bali ubud, the foods and items are locally processed. Of course there are some products and foods by exportation.
**However, the fact is, we can meet local ingedients in here.**

Hawaii looks not like that.
