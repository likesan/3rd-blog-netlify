## I wanna learn something more because I want to be more capable.

what does it mean to be more capable?
for me, the meaning of capability is that you can earn better.

> you become better earner to take the budget or grasp.
You can be higher price than before. for me, that's the meaning of Capable.
You can do something that you want to do.

That's the capable's meaning......
If you have logical mindset, you can do that.
If you have learned how you become best version of you, that is the way of capable.
I want to be like that. 

## What should I do for being more capable?

1. need to wake up at dawn. there is nobody who bother my concentration. I can do whatever I want(but suddenly iron cutting sound is coming here). Nobody cannot disturb me at all. That's the only time to enrich my ability. however, first of all that requires to fall asleep earlier than 10 pm.

2. need to exercise properly to be more learnable. the blood stream will stimulate my brain. for me, that's Ashtanga. Ashtanga challenges my muscles and tissues very intensionally. even I cannot finish the half series. Of course that means my physical needs more practice.. or very poor ability in physic.

3. keep writing down what I really want or why do I want to do it.

    You need to change your subconciousness in positive way. As the law of attraction, If you want to something but if you don't follow it as positive one, it will never come or attact to your life. why? according to many 'secret books', universe lets us to have something similar each other. If we have focus on something, that the simliar things with the 'something' will keep coming into our life. If you thought about cat-poop, **your subconsciousness will keep find out the cat poop in your life.** your external is reflected your internal life. we need watch out our mind. maybe that's why jesus alerted 'never thought lustfully on any woman that is a real crime as well'
