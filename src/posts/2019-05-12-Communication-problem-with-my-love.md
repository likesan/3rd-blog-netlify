# Last night, we got a fight.

we couldn't understand each other.
Of course, we solved the problem, now we're good!
So much good!

The key was the using same language.
She uses paper and writing
but me, I use Laptop and digital media.

That's why our languages or communication didn't meet in between.

# The solution was from another French Friend, Jyoseph.

We met in Sawobali, buffet restaurant in Ubud,
It was secondary time to meet together.

Then he shared his idea on our problem.

What he said, our language is different each other,
so **put it on a paper what she needs.**
as **man is better to recognize on visual article**, in compare of woman's auditory information.

That was so happy to have him in sudden...
If not, we couldn't be happy again.
because she will think I have a problem with in the communication within her.


that's too funny thing sometimes, although she doesn't buy what I say but follow some other's oppinion...
