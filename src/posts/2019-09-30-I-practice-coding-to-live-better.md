# I want to live better.

I need to keep building the blog by Reactjs. Why? I need better platform for it.
I need to spread my word and idea. I need to people understand what is my strengths and skill. then I could meet the better opportunities.
Well, That is the reason why I try to make another blog, though we can just 1 click to have a blog through another platform.

I want to gain my coding skill.
I believe that is the way to develop my capacity..


# in 21 centry, I can feel when I could make something well, That is the power, ability and wealthy itself.
I've always dreamed to have a capacity to do something.
but understanding and accurately buildable a program as much as I wish,
That is amazing, because thesedays every wealthy needs the software! Since the smartphone and laptop is everywhere to do some works for people,
We can make a software to do something it.


# Since I've started this ReactJs, I feel so happy.
Somehow, I can make the visual things as much as I could,
I can start to form a platform to spread my voice and thought on the world.
I want to make a change through this.

This is really what I want to do.
So happy thing.
