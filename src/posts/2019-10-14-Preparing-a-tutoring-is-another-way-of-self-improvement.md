# Preparign a tutoring is another way of learning.
There are so many vocabularies that I've learned!
I can learn something from the preparation.

## How?

### New vocabularies.

**If I teach same topic in Korean, They get frustration.**
I should have to teach in English.
Because they can understand in English.
I found that happening last time.

When I tried to go up the level of expression in Korean,
Felt Christine(Indonesian-American Student) got nervous and depressed.
If we just keep pushing them in so hard level,
**They will just drop off or the seed of motivation will be turned off.**
We don't have to do that.

The point is, whenever I searching for the real way to explain them into simple and easy term, **unrevealed linguistic expressions get spotlight.**

Eg. When I was finding out some lyrics, Found the difference in between `searching for` vs `looking for`

```
우린 서로 다른 꿈을 찾았던거야
We were searching for each different dreams.
```
We can use Looking for in above phrase, but wish put something more serious meaning, then 'searching for' is right to go.

and 
```
멀어져가는 오후를 보다
I looked at the afternoon drifting off
```

I never seen `drifting off` before.
getting away or going by I've known but,
yeah I found this can be used for a thing that slowly move away from me.


like these cases, **I found preparation of tutoring Korean is quite helpful for even self-improvement.**
