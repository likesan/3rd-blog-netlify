# I'd like to learn the request and respond things in server side as well more deeply

because these writings set it fires my desire to learn that.

# Well actually when Serverside, and front are together, I feel more fun. 

I thought am a fullstack person.
Of course I've remembered when I firstly succeeded to 4 digit numbers password unlocked by
Java's unlimit for loop number requesters.
I never experience like that before. however, when I did it in first time, in the bootcamp in South Korea,
That was super amazing, even my skin got goosebump.
Yes, I love coding not only serverside, but also frontside itself? or yet, I cannot say surely?
Django was fine but I've liked that as well.
I can send more information to the front, I can send something more backend, 
those all movement are fun themselve

# Javascipt is the language to satisfy all my desires at the back and front both.

Javascript is friendly and easy to learn. Jquery, Ajax, Bootstrap, Firebases and etc. Whenever I've practiced and tried to make my own projects, they were just there so closely to be handled under my hands.

# I found JS is very rich and powerful langauge more than we that perceive. 
The usauge boundary is quite wide and generously accepted.
Server side, nodeJS. Frontside, ReactJs and etc. In the bridge, Ajax or Jquery. That is all rounder player. I love that.

Even I want to introduce myself 'SJ, which is reversed JS. I want to reverse this world by JS'. HA XD So funny.
