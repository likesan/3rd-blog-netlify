# So thanks to meet Gaby.

It makes better options for us.
We can make more money by her's exportation of Eco Plastic bags.
because she can makes the exportation, that items demand is so huge in South Korea.

But the problem is, My needs of storage in South Korea.
Although she makes the items dropping on South Korea, there is no place to store it.
Or, I can choose a port nearby my parents, then my parents can just send the parcels into the destinations..
yes, 

# To use my parents as a dropping area.. but

needs are the capital.
as the minimum order quantity should be 300,000 per once.
So it should

but.. my parents are not agile and collective...
They are old and easy to make a mistake..

# The middle man must be collective and responsible...

What if I make the **cloud fund?**



But Mr.Kim doesn't show up his interest yet.
Because He is in the business meeting, so, he will show

but what if he doesn't make chance on me?
So.. it can be worse..

Rather I should find out how can I make it up by myself.

Maybe I should make a platform? to sell that one?
but It's really good to sell the thing through ...
hm..

I don't know let's see it on tomorrow.

I want to manage these all up so easy and simple way.
How can I do that?

# focus on only big cake.

Then need to define what is the only big and huge cake?
Need to quantify the `quality`?
