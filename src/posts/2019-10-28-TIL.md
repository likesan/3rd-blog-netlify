- How come 2^-1 can be existed?
  - Didn't know how this could work, but [found a post.](http://blog.naver.com/PostView.nhn?blogId=woney48&logNo=220877843627&categoryNo=59&parentCategoryNo=0) 
  - `a^3/a^2 = a^3-2 = a^1`
  -` a^3 * a^2 = a^3+2 = a^5`

- Question 17, 논리와 증명 / 수와 표현, Learning course, in Samsung Expert AcademyProve, `Log 2^5 -> Irrational number`. 
  - I've used, `proof of contradiction(귀류법)`.
  - for that, I should had to built contradictive proposition.
    - If, `log 2^5 is rational number` of state results `false`, the origin proposition is `true`.
  - then rational number could be expressed by co-prime numbers of fraction by `a/b`.
  - so, `log 2^5 = a/b` should result `false`
    - then `5 = 2^a/b`
  - to simplify `a/b` square, multiply `b` in both side of square.
    - then `5^b = 2^a`.
    - 5^b = { 5, 10, 15, 20 ...}, and 2^a = { 2, 4, 6 , 8 ...}
    - so they're not equal, this proof of contradiction results `false`.
    - Conclusionally, `Log 2^5 -> Irrational Number` state results `true` proved 
- refered a blog [post](https://ctrl144.tistory.com/entry/%EB%AC%B4%EB%A6%AC%EC%88%98-%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8-%EC%A6%9D%EB%AA%85) and [ebsi mathematic clip, 30강 로그](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAMLiw9BpiA)


- Q 18, Prove `1+2+3+...+ n = n(n+1)/2` with `mathematical induction`
  - Mathematical induction meaning, when induct same value in both side, if the result would be same, the origin state is `true`
  - so I should have to induct `n + 1` in both side? hm.. or not>

- I wasn't sure How to choose a way to prove when I see a question for `prove`
  - so I've asked about this how to do through Kakao Openchat.
    - some people answered, `whatever the way of proof is, that doesn't matter`. `the matter is just 'to prove! or to show the way of prove!`
    - and another one sent me this [link](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1476268/mathematical-induction-proof-1-sqrt1-1-sqrt2-1-sqrt-n-ge-sqrt-n) which is totally proving the state.
