I have wondered what is top priority in our living.

but now, finally got what is that.

It's investment on myself.
My capacity doesn't go anywhere, not like other properties or possessions.

Especially money or friends, they're going away so easily.

But your ability to get friendliness or skill of hang around doesn't shade away that simple way.

it means, whenever you get down of your life, you can turn back the previous status.

it means you do not need be afraid of something, or get terrified from trying new adventure in your life.

whenever you want, you can simply go back where you've been.

that's great ability. sometimes we call it is 'Resilience'.

The resilience is called the essential skill more than anything in our life.


well, I got this idea from an yoga class. As an yoga class or inspirational activity brings some good idea as vipassana, I believe this insight is a true wisdom.


wish tohold it here before it disappear away...
