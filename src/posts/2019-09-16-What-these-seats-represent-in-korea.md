## Single-member electorate system

Korea's electorate system is Single-member electorate system.
S.Korea has 253's eletoral districs, then the rest of 47 seats comes from propotional representation system.

the problem is, this electorate system occurs dead vote which doesn't represent the minor votes. So S.Korea assembly sets the proportional representation system with Single-member electorate system.

## Propotional representation system.

When S.Korean votes for the Parliamentary election, they get 2 ballot papers.
First one is for his favorite candidate, Second one is to pick a favorite party.

and then, the 47 seats devided by the rate of voted.
