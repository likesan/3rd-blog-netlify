# Dogs were whining.
I didn't know what was the cause,
but a ton of time I'd teach them with a stick, but they didn't change.

## So rather I looked up the way to change them.
That was love.

They needed to assure the pecking order with me
How I found this? because, whenever tried to hit them, they rather never change but insisting that attitude on me.
keep whining, never follow my order...
## the second one I tried him having walked around within tie, but he rather chooses do not follow my lead.
That was a little shocking...

That was the main reason why I decided to look it up.

## and many articles explain 'why I shouldn't hit them,  but rather should make them understanding the pecking order'.
since I tried a blanket to lay down the bottom of them for their sleeping, it means I admitted they are the higher level.
That was another shocking because I just wanted care about their sleeping more cozier.
## I had to understand their language first, although I didn't decide to foster them first...

anyway, they are quite now since I've tried to execute some practical things to them.
first , I tried make expose their belley by turning them back to the sky.
First one tried to keep resisting from it, but I said 'Nope!' and a little bit physically push him down.
then stood for 5-10 mins? I found he becomes a little bit more meek and submissive. and I'd rubbed his belly. Without rubbing, he was resisting the posture, **but rubbing had been the key.**

That was fantastic.

## Eventually, they are so quiet now. They look much more peaceful.
although that was a main reason why we considered them to throw away or giving Bawa as giving up.
Of course, their skin is getting severer but we found an apple vinegar can be the remedy. we will try it to them.
Vinegar was effectful even for Wholesome's sibling's coming out of inner parasites
