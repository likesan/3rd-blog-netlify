I've tried to re-install the markdown based posts
within another library.

I've used the `React-Markdown`. 
# However, I couldn't find out how to the header or frontmatter pulling out.
I needed to show the hashtags or categories since my previous Gitpage Jekyll posts have fulfilled the tags, category, and thumbnails.

If your markdown files have the full listed of frontmatter, I recommend to use this library,
# `Remark-React`

[The link is here I anchor.](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-react)


Their usage is based on the texting something in text area, so you need to adjust the script into your taste.

in my case, I've just wanted to make it 

then I've written `yarn add remark-react` in cmd line.


# After the installation.

I needed to make the previous `React-Markdown` installed post to
the `remark-react` installed post. There was just a few changes.
