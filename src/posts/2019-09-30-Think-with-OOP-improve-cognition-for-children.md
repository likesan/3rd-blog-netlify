# What is the Object Oriented Program.
That is one of most popural question for the new candidate in interview with a company. 
That is the question to check their understand and knowledge about their Coding.

## For me, Learning a coding is learning language.
Actually There true name is 'Software Language, Computer Programming Language'. Language for computer.

`A train is going.`
we need understand there is a movement to go forward which is 'verb' form.
and secondly, a subject 'A train' which is making the movement 'to Go' in somewhere.
We need to put them together makes 'A train is going'.

So we make a 'a train' as a variable in software programming, `Going` is a movement which is 'function' in Software programming.

# That's far simple like this.
and that is the OOP.
Oriented means 'is closed to A'.
Object is the subject to do something.
Programming is the coding what we make.

To seperately think in 2 existance, Verb and Subject.
That is the OOP.


# Coding is very powerful method.
**That makes a practice and trainning how should we understand a concept or world.**
When we think about the fact. Fact is made up of an occation.
A person, A movement, the Environment surround, Timing etc.
When we try to code to make something happening or a task easily opperated,
# We need break down the sitatuion.
We need understand the composition of situation. 
# That improves our objectives observation ability either we cognize it or not.

# I guess that is the reason why Obama and modern country's leaders ask to teach those children with the coding.
