# List of Skills

the strong skills represent my aspects where I feel joy whenever I cultivate it.

That skills are like this.

Meditation, Photographing, Analytics, Self-management(Time management, Put reflective insight on my daily schedules)

* Mediation

    actually this is major skill that I should cultivate, because this skill influences on other skills improvement.
    As I do meditate a few hours in a day, All sense get bettter. 
    All senses includes like Recognition, Smell, Taste, Vision, Hearing and Thinking. All my sense get better. Even sometimes a great insight comes into my head. **The insight solves a question at that time.**
    Even Emotional status is so positive and happy!

    * Vipassana

    * Kundalini Yoga
    
* Analytics Mindset (=Growth Hacking Mindset)

    It's a column of other skills. Analytics means that I calculate all things in my life. **If I can calculate, then I can control it.** Sharply measuring can help to decide the next step, 'Should I keep do this? or stop this?'

* Self Management Skills(Time management, Reflection)

    * Time Management

        Responsively time managing is one of key skill in our life. Our life is made up of 'time'. When time is running out, our life is gone and done.
        Yes. **Time is the best resource. It can be converted by Money or Any other resource.** It means it's more valuable than any other things on this world. Ever.

    * Reflection

        Each Activity in my day, I should review it for making it better at next time. If we do review it by recommenting it, by questioning 'how much is that if I score that activity? only 5? why 5 do I put the score? My concentration wasn't enough? or the teacher's instruction wasn't adequate? or my focus was on other things? Did I lost my mind? why?' by **those questions, I could figure out what was the main reason of that activity's result.** That review and revision leads next time better performance by adjusting that issue.

* Coding

    In this century, this is a hack skill that values up my labor's price. I can automate repetitive works or tasks through building a program. The program can alternate me with 10 times better performance. Then I can cultivate other skills with the saved time.

* Photographing

    as I've started it from my Elementary school, It has continued for almost 20 years.


# Define the top skill by Quantification list.

`Do focus on your top skill.` 
That's what the 20:80 principle's author said through his book.
He said, the maximized ability comes out when focus on a top skill. Even another book, another Bestselling book in NY, `You're a bad-ass to make money` said, I should follow up a skill that makes my heart beat so much. The skill occurs a heart so excited and lift up the feeling so high.

So, I should focus on the activity and skill what feels so positive in my heart.
and figure out which skill scores highest?

I need to quantify all above skill sets.
That will define where should I put my energy.
