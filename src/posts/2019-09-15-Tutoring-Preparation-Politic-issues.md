## 2. What each party believes, argues, and stand for?

Note: the word liberal in South Korea is often used by conservative groupings(Such as [Liberty Korean Party, '자유한국당'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Korea_Party)) in the European fashion. (The Korean Liberty Party, the conservative party, uses "Liberty" as conservative Tea Partiers do in the United States.) Liberal parties (in the American sense of the term) **tend to label themselves as "Democratic" or "Progressive" instead.**

There has been a tradition of liberal parties since 1955, often organized around persons. Presently the **Democratic Party of Korea**, and the People's Party are the main successors of the liberal parties' tradition.
