Finally I go back home..(?)

# Macbook..

but I don't know how to get it..?
If I work so hard, then I can get it so simply quickly

hm...
## but what should I suppose to do there?

1. Fix the laptop

though I'll do nothing..


3. Earn more money?

actually... Need to make a webpage?


4. Buy clothes?

Dongmyo?
I do not know... Should I visit the Paju once? I don't know...
If I visit there, I can try to sleep once, then I can make to visit the Dongmyo later.
Because there isn't that much far from here?


5. Make some more incomes?

Well... come to think of it..
I feel this is enough to stay?
I don't know... rather that's lack of it.
# I want to be free from concern of budget.

yeah... this is my true desire.
however, sometimes I think this is enough to live.
people just help me up when I need help in budget.
somehow that is a miracle...
but I don't want to keep begging ? or asking to help...?
hm...
hell yeah.
but sometimes I feel that's fine..?
...
I do not know..
# rather I want to help people by some way of it.
but ... what is that?
I really want to just keep learning something?
yes..
but I'm going to have some work.
sometimes I can help people in ...
# yeah if I have much more budget, I can help people in very good way.
If he has really good way of his business, I'd like to invest him.
Why? that will bring us more budget to achieve my dream.
I need to learn how to invest things...

but making a youtube content is kinds of that?
Isn't it?
I can make the golden guss who returns the income for us.
# That'll set us free from economical slavery.
We'll not need to keep working and concerning.
Rather we can set our budget into more freedom, more capacity on our works.
That's pretty simple?
hm..

How can I make that? the economical freedom?
That looks we can do many things in a once.
How?
need to be youtuber? Need to learn something?
What Should I do?


then we have to have a company? enterprise?
What should we do?
Which company do I want to have?
which problem do I want to solve?
I know...
there is so many problem...
TNR counts are lower than the incresing numbers of cats.
hm...
# But the real problem is... really need is managements of the whole cat numbers.
probably we should have to follow the Korea's way.
If we register the cat's chip, on the database,
then we can check how many cats we need.

then we can compare the numbers of unsterilized cats and sterilized cats.
If not, just we do work as rule of thumbs.
we cannot make exact estimations...

yeah but actually I don't want to make that huge things..?
why?
## because I don't want to make burden or getting too much businesses in my life?
yeah...
and I don't want to get too much stresses...?
yeah...
## then how can I get no stress but solve problems?

# How can I solve problems automatically without my whole engagement?

hm... Make a system? need reading a book...
beccause I don't 'know' about this that much...?
