- **Doing lightly is the key to continue or build a productive habit.**
  - Today, I've done some Yoga, because my body got too stiff everywhere. 
  - Nomally, I didn't like to do Daily Yoga but interval. That was against my will. Sometimes just chilling out of my body is best option for a day.
  - but after a few weeks without any other stretching, the stiffness had been ringing the red sign from my all body.
  - even my love belly is getting thicker and thicker.
  - for the all begin, I should start a yoga again.
  - Just doing Half series are fine. More than pushing myself until the End.


- I should have to write down the SamSung sw academy note for mistakes.
  - because that I know about a knowledge completely, but only the mistakes on past quiz.
  - maybe this markdown file can be the note for it.
  - such as `False ∧ False is True? or False?`, I was so confusing with this. Although I don't get that when I write conditional lines in coding.
  - but someone in Quora said, `Lie + Lie is Big Lie, That was my teacher's description.` That I couldn't mistake with this condition any longer.
  - Even `False ∨ False is true? or False?`, then It's `False` as well. (but I don't know how to prove through lines.)
  - the opposite of `≤` is `≥`.
  - the opposite of `＜` is `＞`, not `＞ and =`. I was confused here.

- I found the great designers think about people and world.
  - Steve jobs's wife, Pawel Jobs said a design should have to be good for the life of user.
  - Here the common sense about design, is that **a design has to be good for the user**. 


- Rational number is able to express on fraction, `b/a(a!=0)` 
  - why? because if a number cannot be expressed on Rational number, that is Irrational number.( but how to prove it? )
  - infinitely continueing demical number is irrational number. so irrational number cannot be handled.
  - If a number can be calculated and measured, that does mean could be handled so that is rational number.
  - If a number can be devided, that means the number can be controled and handled. That is meaning of `rational`. Possible to check and to handle.
  - but Irrational number is infinitely continuing, so cannot be measured or be handled. because **we cannot see the whole frame and size itself**.
    - when we don't know something, then we cannot control it.
    - so if we can measure or math something, that means we can handle it.
    - so that means if we want to handle it, we can control it.
    - because we can see its size.
  - Human cannot describe the irrational number, because the Irrational number infinitely continue without any patterns in demical. **So we cannot see the end.**
  - so, if we cannot see the pattern continued and how many continue... we cannot measure it.
  - that's why irrational number cannot be calculated, but we frame it as a `irrational number`. **I feel amaze how this world creates this concept...**. Mathematic is able to frame that world's mistical and mysterious concept...
  

  - Talk about politic is tiring.
    - because I should have to check what is true and false
    - that is another homework.
    - but although a politic getting worse a little, that doesn't mean my life getting worse totally, but rather if I don't study for my ability that I should have to have, that is far worse than lose in politic. because a politic without me is fine but me without my ability is critic.
    - my ability is the essential.
