# What is rich?
Rich means for me, to be full of capability and freedom. If you have enough freedom as much as you can draw on your canvas. You dream what you want, you draw what you want on your page. 

## You do what do you really want. 
You put the activty what you really want to do. **The process itself to achieve the goal is rich itself.** If you make your day with your activities which are on your list, That is the Rich and Achievement. Some people call it 'Bucketlist', 'Priority List','Bulletpoint' and so on.

## The matter is You do what you really want to do, or just want to do.
You need to manage your assset to do all the things. Actually In my country, we call a budget is a bullet to pierce what you're targetting for, as a metaphor. So if you don't manage your bullets, You cannot shoot or knock down your goal or target. You need the bullet. The bullet is money and asset. Because in modern age, every things are made up of Money. How?
This is the capitalism. Everything is made up of money and labour. Money comes from the people who values your work or service. If your content or service values up their life, they will pay for you.

I'll post about Passive income in another.
