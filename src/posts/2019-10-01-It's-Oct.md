# Time is flying away.
It is October, Finally...
I could move out the house soon.
After 4 hours, we should packing all the things,
Calling a grab then, pin the destination,
We can move out.

However, the matter is teaching her riding motorbike.
But she seems already good with that.

then what should I do?
since last writing, I feel so good.
Life is just like this.
Minimalism brings something more happiness in our mind and life.
That's quite incredable.
